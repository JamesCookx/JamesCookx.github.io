<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately constant, usage never exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
