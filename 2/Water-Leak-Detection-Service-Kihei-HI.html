<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure utilized to purify water utilized for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen travel through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and eliminated. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to get rid of any leftover contaminants.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are created to provide years of security. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all cause the assembly to degrade in its efficiency.
