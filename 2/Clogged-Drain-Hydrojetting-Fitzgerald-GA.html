There's an excellent opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their life expectancy. As galvanized pipes age, they start to corrode.

In some cases the leak or drip will be caused by a damaged faucet, worn washers or seals, wore away -rings and gaskets, or elements that are merely too old and need to be replacement.
