<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
