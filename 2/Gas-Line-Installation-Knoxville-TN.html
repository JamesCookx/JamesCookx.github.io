<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Generally, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like material coated with positively charged salt ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water draining of the device is now considered soft.</p>

<h3>Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Plumbers Knoxville TN</h3>
<p>Salt-free systems will likewise minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothes and softer skin using a healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without having to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have a negative impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to ban salt-based softeners due to the high salt content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and use no waste water, no electrical energy and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are incredibly low maintenance because the media can last as much as five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be replenished on a month-to-month basis.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
