<p>Hidden sets of pipes use pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet up with a larger one beneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the house. A great way to lower the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal. Rapidly and effectively removing leftover potato peels, fruit rinds and lots of other kinds of food waste, the disposal grinds all of it into fine particles that are eliminated of the chamber and into your home drainage, waste and vent system or what you most likely call your sewer.</p>
<p>There are two popular install systems used for garbage disposers: the standard 3-bolt mount (if you have actually had a disposer set up for some time, it's most likely installed by doing this) and a more recent system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the same task with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name suggests, the EZ Mount mechanism is intended to be much easier to handle when installing or fixing an unit.</p>
