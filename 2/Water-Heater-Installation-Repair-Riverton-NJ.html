<p>Sodium intake from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for salt chloride might be suitable if health or environmental reasons demand limiting salt. With time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and have to be cleaned up. This cleaning process, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: backwash, recharge and rinse. The regeneration process can be arranged automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
