<p>Main sewer repair involves substantial excavation, shoring up supporting walls, removing and communicating pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for short-term cover. Service lines which originate from private property and feed into the main line are a normal area for leaks or breaks. Off-road tasks outside the right-of-way require a lot of manual work for excavation and transporting materials, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, usage never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
