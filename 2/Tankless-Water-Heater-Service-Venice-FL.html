<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are usually installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is greater than demand (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily stored for later use when demand rate surpasses supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
