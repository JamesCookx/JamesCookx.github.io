<p>The US Department of Energy says that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating & cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to offer soft drinks beverages. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically dissolves the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate service (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been proven to be a threat to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Additional requirements: no piping including copper will be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>
