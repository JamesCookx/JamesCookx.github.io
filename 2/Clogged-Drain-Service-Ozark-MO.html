<p>How does ion exchange work? A chemical and physical process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Typically, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium dissolves into positively charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water flows through the unit while the resin launches its salt ions and readily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>

Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.
