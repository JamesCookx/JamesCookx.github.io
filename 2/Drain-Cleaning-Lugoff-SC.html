<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
