<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has 2 check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high threat" facilities.</p>
<p>Hard water, particles from old pipes or particles from a break in a city water line can prevent a flush valve from closing totally. Running water through it from the supply line will clear the debris. Photos 1 and 2 show you how to do this on one typical kind of valve. Even though other valves will look various, the clearing process is similar. Nevertheless, you might have to eliminate a few screws on top of the fill valve to remove the cap.</p>
