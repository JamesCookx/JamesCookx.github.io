<p>Reverse osmosis is the procedure used to cleanse water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through three phases. In the prefilter phase, large particles like silt and rust are eliminated by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen pass through the pores while dissolved solids are captured and gotten rid of. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last phase of filtration to eliminate any leftover pollutants.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- destructive. For this factor, WQA advises that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is simply catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or often potassium).</p>
