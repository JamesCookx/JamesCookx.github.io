<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to blockages that stem inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible water supply line. They're a lot easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Be sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh.
