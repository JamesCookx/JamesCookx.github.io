<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Low Water Pressure - Low water pressure is the leading problem with most houses and business' alike. Merely stated it is difficult to get casserole dishes or any large serving piece clean with no pressure in the faucet or sprayer. Mineral deposits are likewise a significant perpetrator, blockages from food bits, blockages in aerator screens all definitely stop water flow. The most serious could be water leaking, blocked lines to the cut off, or perhaps worse a frozen pipe coming into the house or building.</p>
