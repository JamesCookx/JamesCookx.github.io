<p>To help avoid clogs within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of utilize the technique set out above. Because the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
