<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decrease in provided pressure to the water flow, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe segment flows backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply motion. This opposite flow is usually localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from nearby heavy equipment operations, settlement of nearby soil or shifting structures, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, and so on. The result is a complete breakage, dislocation or cracking in the pipe that enables water to get away.
