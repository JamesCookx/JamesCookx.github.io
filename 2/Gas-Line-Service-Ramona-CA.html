This is especially real when the waste needs to take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
