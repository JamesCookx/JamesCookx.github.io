<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the solidity ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about fully restored.</p>
