<p>Align the rubber seal ring on the top of the disposer with the flange below the sink.

<p>Do yourself a favor and purchase a flexible supply of water line. They're a lot much easier to install than stiff metal or plastic tubing. Make sure to get one that's covered with stainless steel mesh. For an excellent seal, hold the hose so it aims straight into the shutoff or fill valve while you're screwing on the adapters. Make them handtight, then include another quarter turn with pliers. Links that are too tight can actually cause leakages or spin the fill valve inside the tank. If required, inspect for leaks and tighten them a bit more.</p>
<p>You'll wish to keep a look for leakages too, naturally. Even small ones that are quickly repaired might be signs that the time for whole-house replacement is approaching.
