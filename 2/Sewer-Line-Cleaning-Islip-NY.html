<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Sink parts that your Candu Pro can service include the faucet, handles, supply lines, trap, dishwasher lines, and stopper. If you have a waste disposal unit in your sink that needs to be serviced, we can help you find a Candu Pro for that, too. Gas leak repairs cost $6 to $7 per linear foot or $75 to $150 per hour. Where the leak takes place identifies just how much the repairs cost. A gas pipe repair to a single appliance averages between $150 and $650, based on the pipe, area, and distance product.</p>
