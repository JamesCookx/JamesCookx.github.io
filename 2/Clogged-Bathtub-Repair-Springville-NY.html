Our team of extremely experienced experts will lessen the effect our work has on the structure of your home or office and get your system working quickly, safely, and cost effectively. Water solidity is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The reason you can feel the distinction on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum. This leads to the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's difficult to wash in.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
