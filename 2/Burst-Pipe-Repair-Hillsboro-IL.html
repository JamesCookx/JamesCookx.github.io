<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, reduced iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Once again, it is suggested to inspect the maker's directions for unique safety measures.</p>

This procedure is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make certain to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
