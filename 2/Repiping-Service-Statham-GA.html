<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly constant, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and easily kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
