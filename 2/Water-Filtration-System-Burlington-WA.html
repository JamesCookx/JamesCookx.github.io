<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
