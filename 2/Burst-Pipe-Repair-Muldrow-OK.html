<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or substances a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, appropriately set up and maintained backflow assembly essentially removes the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage.
