We've currently seen what these 2 terms have in common, so what's the difference between them? When it concerns the issue of tough water, a traditional water softener in fact removes magnesium, calcium and silica ions, leaving it with small amounts of what is called momentary hardness". The softener changes these ions with salt through a procedure called ion exchange.</p>
<p>Water that has actually been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been eliminated-- destructive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not eliminate the TDS and do not trigger this type of deterioration A softener is simply capturing some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations in the process (normally sodium or often potassium).</p>

<p>Small Leaks - A leak does not always imply that your water heater's going, it may simply be condensation. However it also could mean that your tank welds or pipe fittings are used. A plumber is needed if this is the case. When most people think of plumbers, they normally call them for water pipe issues. The natural gas plumber will have a license that states she or he is licensed to deal with and install natural gas lines. Property owners must consider whether the plumber has a master plumbing license, which represents a high degree of experience, credentials and knowledge.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is entirely stripped of calcium and magnesium to end up being soft, it frequently becomes destructive. Destructive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in locations where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Many residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with special venting systems likewise are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
