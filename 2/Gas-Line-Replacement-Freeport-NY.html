<p>Backflow prevention devices are designed to safeguard the public water supply from cross-connections. A contemporary community water supply system is created to guarantee that water flows to homes and structures under pressure. If there is a cross-connection in between the water supply and an infected source, this neighborhood water network contains many users where there is a risk to public health. A cross-connection can occur where there is a pressure drop in the water pipe. This pressure drop triggers a vacuum and siphons of entrainment water from end-users into the general public water supply.</p>

Short-lived water will be allowed after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly consisting of a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be securely attached to strong rebar or wooden stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is substantially complete is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and immediately evaluated to ensure it is working.</p>

<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Freeport NY</h3>

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to decrease its mineral material.

Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a strict low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
