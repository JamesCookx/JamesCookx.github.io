A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), connect the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

Each achieve the very same task with little difference, aside from their installation.
