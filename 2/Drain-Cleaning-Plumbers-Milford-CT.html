Note: It's most likely a great idea to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to prevent forgetting to shut it off later. If there's anything worse than being surprised by a live wire, it's being surprised by a live wire while under a sink.

The problem with any leak or drip with a faucet is identifying the root source. In some cases the leak or drip will be triggered by a damaged faucet, broken washers or seals, corroded -rings and gaskets, or components that are just too old and need to be replacement. If you find that your faucet is leaking or dripping consistently, contact Resurrection Plumbing ASAP to finish an inspection, so the right repairs can be made.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the choice normally comes down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is long lasting and more economical than copper.
