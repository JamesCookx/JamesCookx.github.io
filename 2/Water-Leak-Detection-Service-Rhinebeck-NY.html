<p>Unless your bathroom restoration is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may very well belong to your job requirements. Water gets in the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has an unfavorable charge, which brings in the positively charged minerals in the water (a process called, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and flows throughout your home. Tankless innovation makes good sense.
