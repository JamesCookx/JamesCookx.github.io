<p>A lot of toilets used today run with a standard gravity flushing design, indicating they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewer system. Just recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in a growing number of houses.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of a lot of repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet difficulties. For instance, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can start to solidify and split or merely be so crushed that it doesn't fill the area along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Just like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can become so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we strongly suggest likewise changing your gasket and your bolt set to make certain whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
