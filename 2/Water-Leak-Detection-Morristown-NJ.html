<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet performance- The higher the performance of the toilet, the more it costs.

<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the approach set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste needs to travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
