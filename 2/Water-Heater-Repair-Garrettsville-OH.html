<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
<p>She understood about the service call fee. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation discovered that's a typical fee. Consumer Private investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of business we called would give an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before committing to a price, and all wished to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
