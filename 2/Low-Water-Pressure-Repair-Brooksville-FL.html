The auger's corkscrew-shaped tip assists force it further down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>

The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close.
