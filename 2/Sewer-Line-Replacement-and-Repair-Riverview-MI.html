If you smell a gas leak in or around your home, there are security preventative measures you should take to protect yourself, your family and your home. Some jurisdictions also permit options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
