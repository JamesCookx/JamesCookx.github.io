<p>Unless you have a cunning two-year old who enjoys to throw bathroom tissue down the toilet, you need to not have regular obstructing problems. In reality, you must hardly ever have a clogged toilet if you are using it appropriately and if it is functioning appropriately. If you are having a toilet that clogs continuously and in need of toilet repair from Vegas Valley Plumbing on a regular basis, then it's most likely time for a brand-new toilet.

<p>Sometimes a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. Snaking the drain won't fix the concern if this is the case. You might have to look into using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, be sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can look at the entire system.</p>
