I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>

Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most typically in the winter season.

We recommend setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to inform you of any potential gas leaks if you have not done so currently.</p>
