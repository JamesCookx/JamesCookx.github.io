<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to access to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.
