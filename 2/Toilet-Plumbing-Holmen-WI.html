<h3>Modern Water Leak Detection Technique in Holmen WI</h3>
<p>106.2.1 Repairing Leakages.

<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. For the most part, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). Inspect the instructions if your valve is a different design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Image 7).</p>
