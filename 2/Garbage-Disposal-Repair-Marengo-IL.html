<p>Your sewer line issue can result in sewer backups, and they generally occur in the most affordable open drain. This type of problem is normally the result of an obstruction in the line. If you do not discover the smell originating from the sewer backup, you may identify this problem because a backup happens whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for correct drainage.

Again, it is a good idea to check the maker's instructions for unique preventative measures.</p>
