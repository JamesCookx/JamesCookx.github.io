<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual solution is to have the faulty pipes changed. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. If you live in an older home (built pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is an alternative to consider. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for numerous years, however steel ultimately struggles with rust and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>Slow drains. A sluggish drain can be a common plumbing issue, and many blockages can be solved with an easy fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging techniques do not work to fix the slow drain, the issue can be a deeper obstruction somewhere in the main sewer line. Sadly, mainline clogs are generally much larger blockages than need more than basic unclogging techniques, but digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>Harmed or broken gas lines can be incredibly hazardous to your home and family. Natural gas is an odor-free substance so it is vital to look for leaks and any damage routinely.

This produces a backflow condition and the potential for infected water going into the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic product, which means germs will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (along with PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings.
