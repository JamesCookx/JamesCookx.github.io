<p>The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a home, beside heating and cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs. As you house ages the water taking a trip through your pipes collects more sediment. This is why repiping your house makes sense. Then lay a towel in the sink and set the disposal on the flange to keep it from moving.</p>
