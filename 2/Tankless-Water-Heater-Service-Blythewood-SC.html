<p>Nearly all softeners fall under one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a fixed schedule and after that go back to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt.
