Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.
