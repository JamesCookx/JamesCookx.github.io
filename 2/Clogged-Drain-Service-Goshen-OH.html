<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow security.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense fails (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
