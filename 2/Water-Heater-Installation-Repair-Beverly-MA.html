<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather affordable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>For a cutoff switch where the backflow preventer is located upstream of the booster pump( s) - set at 10 psi. You should constantly drip cold water into the garbage disposal while crushing foods.
