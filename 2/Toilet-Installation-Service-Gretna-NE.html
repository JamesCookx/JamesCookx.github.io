<p>Regenerate your softener with potassium chloride instead of salt chloride (salt). Potassium chloride is readily available at most shops that offer softener salt. Since the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system needs less space. Clogged blockage and drainage problems might start as minor concerns but can quickly accelerate into significant issues. A clogged drain can even result in sluggish water drainage, flooding, sewage backup, and expensive repairs.</p>

Assemblies not currently noted must have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
