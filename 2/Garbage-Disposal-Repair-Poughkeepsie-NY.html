<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually test a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
