<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water circulation, takes place. The outcome is a backflow where liquid in the pipe section flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is typically localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more common in smaller pipes based on automobile traffic on overlaying highways, vibrations from surrounding heavy equipment operations, settlement of neighboring soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a complete breakage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that enables water to get away. Often no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, simply the mechanical failure of a key pump whose shut down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
