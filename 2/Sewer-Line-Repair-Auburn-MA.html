<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Auburn MA</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years old and you need to employ a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense might be in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair costs is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are supplying high-quality work and client peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely perform hot water heater replacements. In addition to conventional water heaters, we likewise install tankless water heaters, and heatpump water heaters.</p>

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this boost can present problems.</p>
