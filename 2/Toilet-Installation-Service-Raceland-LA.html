For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>

A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Rather than removing the clog with negative pressure, it in fact pushes into the obstruction, working even more into where the blockage is taking place. The auger or snake" is then utilized to press the clog out of the drain pipe, leaving a clear course for water to flow easily. The auger's corkscrew-shaped pointer helps force it even more down into the clog, making it much easier to clear.</p>
