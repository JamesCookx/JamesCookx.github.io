<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
