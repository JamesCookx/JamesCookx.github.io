<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has already been fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Again, it is suggested to check the manufacturer's directions for unique precautions.</p>
<p>When there are cracks or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is suggested. If damage is severe, replacement of the line is recommended. These are all signs that your system should be inspected by a plumber.

Because these chemicals will just harm the home appliance even more, you should also avoid utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
