<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange mount) enough to push the call a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the install ring from sliding off the flange). Use a flat-blade screwdriver to pry the ring off, and get rid of the install ring and upper "protector" ring versus the sink. The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>
<p>After eliminating standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix. Have steel or iron piping and notice rust-colored water coming from your water home appliances? This is a great indication that your pipes may be rusting from the within and therefore, need to be replaced. Keep in mind that if the rust-colored water only features hot water, the cause might be a rusted out water heater-- not your home's piping.</p>
