<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Giddings TX</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water system where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the irrigation system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of reduce, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, however most of the times it need to be much less water.</p>
<p>A. We strongly recommend a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers block any water from back or negative pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, therefore lowering the danger of contamination of your water source. Lots of towns need using an approved backflow preventer in drip watering systems. You may want to talk to your local town before installing your watering system.</p>
