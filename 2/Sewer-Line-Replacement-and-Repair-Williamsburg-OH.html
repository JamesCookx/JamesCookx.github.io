<p>Run the warm water. Warm water is your good friend, specifically for your kitchen sink. Even if you are extremely cautious with what you put down your sinks, food residues and cooking oils still get away down our drains - especially the kitchen sink. Running the hot water after you have actually used your sink helps clear particles and break up food and oils and keep your drain clear. Channeling occurs when the inbound hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened. If you've ever seen that the busier your organisation is, the better your detergent works, the perpetrator might be an extra-large softener.</p>
