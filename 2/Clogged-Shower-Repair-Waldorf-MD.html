<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the usual service is to have the defective pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced: whole-house repiping. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home (built pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many decades, but steel eventually experiences deterioration and does not have the sturdiness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors.
