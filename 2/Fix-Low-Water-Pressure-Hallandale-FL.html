Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line.
