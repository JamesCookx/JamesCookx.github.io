<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will advise a full repipe in certain communities, based upon our experience.</p>
