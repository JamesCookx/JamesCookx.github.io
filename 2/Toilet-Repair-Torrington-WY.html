<p>While city water does get treated, it is done for functions of removing bacterial problems and making the water drinkable. These are certainly priorities for a municipality and its locals but tough water can adversely impact faucets and devices in a home.

<p>Improperly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task. The gas lines need to be calibrated to the right levels by a certified professional. They reacted quickly for my sewer leak. Jay B and Aaron scoped the task quickly and explained the tactical plan for diagnosis and repair. They kept me educated and stood firm through very tough sewer line clean-up and repair. I will advise SW plumbing for any significant repair work.</p>
<p>Loosen up the screws on the upper install ring (flange install) enough to push the phone a bit - you'll see a little "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from sliding off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if relevant) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>
