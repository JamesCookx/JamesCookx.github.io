If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you hire a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was developed years before that, possibilities are that your home might need comprehensive repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimum rates.</p>

If it's too long, simply connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if necessary, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting journey to the store. To avoid this, make certain the new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one independently at the very same time for about $3.</p>
