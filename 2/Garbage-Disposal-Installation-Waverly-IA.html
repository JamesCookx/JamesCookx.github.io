<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source stay roughly continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply.
