<p>A water heater installation is not the repair on which to hone your plumbing abilities if you're reasonably unskilled. So save yourself some serious trouble by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is.

Understanding the correct order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be essential.</p>
<p>Because they can hamper the blades, cooking oil and other greases must never be put down the garbage disposal.
