Ever since we first opened in 1953, our water softeners have actually made a difference in the lives of many property owners in The United States and Canada and worldwide. Our premium system, the EC4 whole house water softener, is a state-of-the-art item that utilizes a process of ion exchange to eliminate the minerals that trigger tough water.

<p>Your first step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall.

If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Image 5). Check the directions if your valve is a various design from the one we show. After installing the valve (Picture 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Backflow is the undesirable turnaround of flow of water which might bring dirty water or other, dangerous compounds into the general public water supply and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a number of situations that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, swimming pools, or lawn sprinkler systems into City supply of water lines. If it is connected to any outside water source, Backflow can likewise carry water into your plumbing. One example would be a garden hose connected to an external faucet with completion left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>
