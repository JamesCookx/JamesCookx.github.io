Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are responsible for scheduling inspections by calling the workplace number noted on the structure authorization. Inspections should be made after structure excavation (before putting concrete), after rough-in (prior to hiding work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If defective work is found, the inspector will release an infraction notice, and a particular time period is allotted to remedy the problem.</p>
