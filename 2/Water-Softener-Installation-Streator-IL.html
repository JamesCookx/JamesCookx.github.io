<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In most cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, shut off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home.

A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a various design from the one we show, inspect the directions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
