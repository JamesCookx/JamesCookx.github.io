As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon for how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others.

Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in..
