This has at times resulted in people thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there may never actually have actually been a concern in the first location. This thinking can be both detrimental and harmful. Backflow occurrences in water supply are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a decreased pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or nothing approach to backflow security. We need to look at each installation for the danger it provides and then install the appropriate security.</p>
