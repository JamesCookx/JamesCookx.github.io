Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the specialist assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lube needs to be a food grade lubricant to assure the water system is not infected. In most cases the best lubricant is water.

Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out earlier by drawing in dirt and debris or limiting the motion of the component.

<p>Current Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into.

I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
