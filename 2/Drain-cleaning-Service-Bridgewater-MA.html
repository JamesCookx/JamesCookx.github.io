<p>A reduction in supply side pressure brought on by an event such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire battling, triggers the supply pressure to drop below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Check Valve permits the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge up until the supply side pressure once again surpasses the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
<p>So, how does a softener understand when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the kind of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and charge on the basis of an established schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every 3 days, regardless of whether the water really needs it. More recent systems use electronic sensing units that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based upon your water use and therefore only regrow when needed. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they conserve energy and cash-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
