<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite sensible. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
