I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
