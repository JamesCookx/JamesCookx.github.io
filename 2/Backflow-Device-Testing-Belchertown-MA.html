Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly should be tested yearly. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring before running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked yearly to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
