<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage units. Since water need differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, use never exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (normally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
