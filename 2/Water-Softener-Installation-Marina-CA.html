<p>Pipeline video inspection is a form of telepresence used to aesthetically examine the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A common application is for a plumber to figure out the condition of small diameter sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. Repair leaky eves that might drip water onto the meter and freeze. If your water heater is leaking, shut the unit down, and drain it if possible. Water leakages can trigger substantial damage to walls, furnishings, and carpets if left unaddressed. A leaking hot water heater can't be ignored, and you might want to call us for emergency service to reduce the damage.

<p>Your primary step is to shut off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Picture 5). Inspect the directions if your valve is a various style from the one we show. After installing the valve (Image 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water produced in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this salt water travels through the tank, salt ions are transferred (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these hardness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered fully restored.</p>
