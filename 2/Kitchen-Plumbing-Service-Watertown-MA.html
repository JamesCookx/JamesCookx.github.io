<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Watertown MA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventers not conforming to these rules for an offered application and which are worn or broken and need replacement must be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the given application. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most reliable methods of locating the specific location of a plumbing problem. A plumber will place a specifically developed water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video footage to figure out where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be checked each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn watering systems require an each year test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring prior to running the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested every year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your house.
