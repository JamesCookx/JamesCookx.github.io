Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
