<p>Are you sure it's safe for the types of pipes and components in your home? The incorrect type can damage or destroy them. It might be needed to clean your kitchen drain's P-trap to clear the clog. The P-trap is at the curve of the drain under the sink, generally inside a cabinet. Place a pan or bucket below the drain to capture any water or debris that might fall out. Unfasten the P-trap from the drain and clear out anything that is stuck. Then run and replace water through it.</p>
