<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must remain open and the system should be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some components within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not help the assembly work any much better, it is just there to assist the technician put together the parts into the body without developing damage from friction.

It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
