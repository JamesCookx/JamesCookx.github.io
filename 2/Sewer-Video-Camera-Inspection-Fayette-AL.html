A research study performed in 2009 by the Water Quality Research Foundation in combination with the Battelle Memorial Institute, referred to as The Battelle Study, conducted tests to help identify how much energy savings a whole house water softener can supply property owners. The outcomes of that research study suggest that neglected hard water included costs to water heating - as much as 48% in some cases.</p>
<p>A few local authorities require that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't utilize a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any area where it might ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not allow the use of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some don't allow the use of a PVB at all, so contact your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer might spill or spit water out from under the cap when backflow occurs, so it must be installed in a location where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
