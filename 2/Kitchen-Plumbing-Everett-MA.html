<h3>Ensure Your Kitchen Sink Stays Unclogged With Three Easy Steps in Everett MA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
