This backsiphonage condition could lead to a contamination of the plumbing system if the backflow prevention assembly was set up as a service security assembly. Abrams, Paul. "Journalist Center" Roto-Rooter Plumbing, Drains & Water Clean-up Service. Retrieved 2006-10-08.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses released after that date require a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested annually. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need a yearly test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers should be checked every year to guarantee the security of the potable drinking water in your home.
