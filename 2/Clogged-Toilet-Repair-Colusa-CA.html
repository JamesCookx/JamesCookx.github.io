This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that typical metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) must not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of corrosion A softener is merely capturing some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and launching other cations while doing so (generally salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
