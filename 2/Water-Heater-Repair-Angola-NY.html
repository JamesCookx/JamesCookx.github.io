The stopping of leakages in drains, water, soil, waste or vent pipe, provided that if any hidden trap, drain, water, soil, waste or vent pipe ends up being malfunctioning and it becomes necessary to remove and replace the very same with new material, such work shall be considered as brand-new work and an authorization will be gotten and an inspection made as offered in this Code, subject to the arrangements stated in Area 106.2.2.</p>
<p>Finally, the most complicated and advanced backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device includes no less than 5 individually operating valves (2 check valves and a differential relief valve sealed at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water flows at design pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage occurs to the connected service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if expensive) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination could be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
