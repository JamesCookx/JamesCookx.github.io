Once the tank rusts through, there is no chance to repair it; replacement is the only solution. Turn the waste disposal unit over and get rid of electrical cover plate. Pull out wires. Place cable adapter (not consisted of) and run electrical cable television through gain access to hole on bottom of garbage disposal. Tighten cable television connector. Push wires into waste disposal unit (do not displace cardboard guard) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leakages under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Eliminate the drain stopper, and permit the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up gradually, they slowly start to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it might be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your water supply, affecting your water quality.</p>
