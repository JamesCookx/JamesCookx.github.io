<p>Hard water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is normally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
