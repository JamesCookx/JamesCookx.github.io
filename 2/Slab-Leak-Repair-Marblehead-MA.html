<p>Unfortunately, there is a wide variety of things that can clog drain lines, often without us even understanding about it. While clogs are marked by gross smells and slow water flow, they might result in more severe problems, too, like rupturing and back-ups. Secure your drains, and remember to call High 5 Plumbing to look after obstructions As Soon As Possible. Worms for watering systems: Homeowners discovered parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the air pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground sprinkler system. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system drew some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The property owner discovered worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to bathe his kid.</p>
<p>Based upon research carried out by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Research Study, 2011. Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Wipe the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work.

<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply soft drinks drinks. Lots of, if not most, water pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a risk to the digestion system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>
