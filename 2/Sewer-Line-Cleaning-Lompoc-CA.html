<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies Lompoc CA</h3>
<p>When a water supply is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is very important to make certain a backflow condition is not created. The repair specialist must be careful to not develop a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations to lower elevation. This backsiphonage condition might lead to a contamination of the plumbing system if the backflow prevention assembly was installed as a service protection assembly. Abrams, Paul. "Reporter Center" Roto-Rooter Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Service. Recovered 2006-10-08.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential authorizations provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was checked was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked every year. Also permits released for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested annually to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
