Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to remotely line the section of the pipe that is split without needing to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned up and dried, the installers will apply the lining to the problem area. The liner is cured in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the cracks inside the pipe.</p>
