A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes dismantling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
