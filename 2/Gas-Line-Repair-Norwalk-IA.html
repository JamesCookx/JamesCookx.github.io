<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two telltale signs of rust and mineral accumulation are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals accumulate gradually, they slowly begin to restrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you see it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when littles rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, affecting your water quality.</p>

The flange (and associated gasket, if applicable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the new system.</p>

Backflow Preventer meaning: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however prevents it from going backwards in the opposite direction.</p>
