Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many desired uses around your house.</p>
