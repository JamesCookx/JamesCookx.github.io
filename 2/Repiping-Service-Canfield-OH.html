<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
