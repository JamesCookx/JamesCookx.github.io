This has at times led to individuals thinking that backflow issues and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever truly have been a problem in the first location. This thinking can be both counterproductive and hazardous. Backflow occurrences in water systems are an outcome of changes in pressure within that system.  Every system might not need a minimized pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far too many locations we have an all or absolutely nothing approach to backflow security.

Test cocks, or small ball valves, allow the attachment of testing equipment that examines whether the double check assembly is practical.</p>
