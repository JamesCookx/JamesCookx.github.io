<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force.
