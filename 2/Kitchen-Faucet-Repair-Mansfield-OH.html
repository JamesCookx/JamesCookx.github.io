<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as displayed in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain new sinks, but these will be identified to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins freely, without capturing on the gasket.</p>

Prior to leaving the home, the professional restored water circulation and evaluated the pipe.</p>
