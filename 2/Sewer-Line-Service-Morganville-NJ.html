If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very little plumbing system). When you call to arrange your visit, ask how long the inspection generally takes.</p>
<p>Require backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a premises as described in the state needed plumbing codes.
