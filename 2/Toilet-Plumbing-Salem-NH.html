<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Subsequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was evaluated at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was tested was attached. By code this backflow assembly must be tested yearly. Also permits issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the watering system.
