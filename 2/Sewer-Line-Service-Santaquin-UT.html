I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole. After repairing this preliminary problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
