An undamaged main sewer line should be airtight, meaning no odors should get away the pipes. If you begin to smell something nasty, however, that might imply a leak in the main sewer line.

<p>Gas hot water heater are easier to repair than electrical ones. A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP garbage disposal system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods.
