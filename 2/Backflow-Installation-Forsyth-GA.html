<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical type of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense.

If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That indicates that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both inspect valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could happen. That is why this type of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
