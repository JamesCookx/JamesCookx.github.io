<p>Your initial step is to shut down the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right next to the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, turn off the water supply at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a great time to include a shutoff valve beside the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is also a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height prior to you install the valve (Photo 5). Check the instructions if your valve is a various design from the one we reveal. After mounting the valve (Photo 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
<p>Naturally, it's always simpler to avoid clogs in the first location. If you have a kitchen waste disposal unit, don't overload it. Feed items in a little at a time, and wait till they grind and run through entirely prior to including more. Never put bacon grease, coffee grounds or oils down your kitchen drain, and constantly make certain you run lots of thin down the drain after each use. It's important to know how to preserve and care for your all your house's plumbing components and systems to keep things running smoothly.</p>
<p>During the installation procedure, IGD Plumbing will develop drywall openings in locations where your hot & cold-water pipes need to connect to plumbing fixtures, toilets, or water heaters.
