However, it usually does not include shutoff valves, might or might not be equipped with test cocks or ports, and is usually less reliable than a DC.

<p>Throughout the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by blending water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this salt water goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues until all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll discover percentages of salt going to drain along with the firmness ions) and the bed is considered fully regenerated.</p>
