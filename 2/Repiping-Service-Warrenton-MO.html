<p>This ion exchange process is facilitated by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for numerous hours, then flush with boiling water. If it does not work the very first time, you can duplicate this process. We do hot water heaters setups and repairs in Carmel, Fishers and Greenfield, IN, Indianapolis and the surrounding counties.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an incident such as a water pipe break, or a heavy water need from activities such as fire fighting, causes the supply pressure to drop below the client side pressure. A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve enables the excess customer side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will release until the supply side pressure once again goes beyond the client side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or up until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
