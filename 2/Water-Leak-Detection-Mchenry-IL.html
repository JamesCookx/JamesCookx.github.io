The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and run independently of each other. A set of four test cocks enable the operator to take a look at the valves and make sure they are not being forced open by accumulated debris. Each spring-loaded check valve is set to enable water at expected functional pressure to stream through. Should backflow take place, either due to siphonage or back pressure, the springs slam the valves shut tight, preventing the entryway of cross contamination water.</p>
