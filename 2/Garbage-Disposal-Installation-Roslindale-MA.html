<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was actually promoted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. Sometimes a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial product or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>
