<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really touted as the pipe of the future.

A clogged or backed up drain pipe is an issue. In some cases a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And sometimes even then absolutely nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and murmuring incantations to the drain gods.</p>

If you start to hear the scoot of little animals, see proof of rats or mice, or encounter the rodents themselves, these things might be an indication that you need a plumber to repair your sewer line.</p>
