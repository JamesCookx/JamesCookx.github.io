<p>In municipal supply of water systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to allow water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or service. When the pressure drops for some reason such as might occur when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other scenario occurs, contaminated water may be drawn into the system. To avoid such an incident, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention technique made use of. The best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). The correct backflow prevention device is required if an air space is not possible. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
<p>A decrease in supply side pressure caused by an occurrence such as a water main break, or a heavy water demand from activities such as fire combating, triggers the supply pressure to drop listed below the customer side pressure. A fouled # 2 Examine Valve enables the excess client side pressure to act upon the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure again goes beyond the customer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
