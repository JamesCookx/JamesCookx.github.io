If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and irrigation, you are likewise required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<h3>Drains Blocked Find A Good Emergency Plumber Now Woodland CA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventers not adhering to these rules for a given application and which are worn or broken and need replacement must be changed by a backflow preventer which does comply to the rules for the given application. A camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most reliable methods of finding the precise whereabouts of a plumbing problem. A plumber will insert a specially created water resistant camera through your sewer line and capture live video to figure out where and what the source of the problem is.</p>
<p>A. We strongly suggest a backflow preventer or vacuum breaker on any shared water source. Backflow preventers obstruct any water from back or unfavorable pressure in your watering system at shutdown from going into back into your water source, hence lowering the threat of contamination of your water source. Lots of municipalities require the use of an approved backflow preventer in drip irrigation systems. You may want to talk to your local municipality prior to installing your watering system.</p>
