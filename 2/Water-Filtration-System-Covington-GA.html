<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet efficiency- The higher the efficiency of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more efficient your toilet is. If there are any lead pipes in the house, find out. Houses that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing.

Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this type of backup.
