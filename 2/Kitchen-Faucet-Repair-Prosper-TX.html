So conserve yourself some major difficulty by being truthful with yourself about where your experience level is. The majority of backflow preventers are designed to allow the parts to be eliminated for repair while the main body remains set up in the piping system. Eliminating the backflow preventer to repair it is not essential for the most part. Some components such as relief valve bodies may need to be removed from the main body to assist in a repair. Understanding the appropriate order for disassembly of the backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>The City of Bellingham needs a backflow preventer on any cross-connection or prospective cross-connection. The backflow preventer might be needed on the water service line, within the structure, or in both locations. The backflow preventer you choose should be listed on the Washington State Department of Health's Approved Backflow Prevention Assembly List. Assemblies not currently noted need to have been noted at the time of the initial installation.</p>
