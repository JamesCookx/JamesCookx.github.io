<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
