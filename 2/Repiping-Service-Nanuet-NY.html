<p>Lastly, the most advanced and complex backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 independently operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve acts as a back up system to the other four. During standard water flows at style pressure, the 2 check valves remain open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by debris or if siphonage strikes the linked service pipeline. To avoid backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a sophisticated and reliable  (if pricey) device is best utilized in important areas where cross contamination might be a direct threat to life and health.</p>
