<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is needed to be installed. An approved, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the risk of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter life expectancy than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is inadequate to make any significant modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electrical choice will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Remove the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Picture 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on certain brand-new sinks, however these will be labeled to that impact. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't use plumber's putty. When you tighten the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the new basket strainer and the sink. Wipe it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
<p>Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair changes to the gas piping system. Sinks should be thought of like a machine.
