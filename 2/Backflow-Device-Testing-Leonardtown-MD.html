<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that can taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hindering water circulation. By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the amount of garbage that gets sent to landfills and other disposing areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
<p>This is among the main and first concerns that you should ask yourself when it comes to repiping and changing plumbing in your house. The age of your home is a critical component to understand whether you need to repipe your home. This is not just because your plumbing has aged with time, but also because homes that were built before a certain period are more likely to include galvanized steel, known to be a metal that is out-of-date on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was built prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. Chances are that your home might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can work at optimal rates if your home was built years prior to that.</p>
