A fouled # 2 Inspect Valve permits the excess customer side pressure to act on the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Relief Valve discharge. Water will discharge until the supply side pressure once again exceeds the consumer side pressure and closes the Relief Valve or until the shut-off valves are closed.</p>
