In some cases during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak immediately and in some cases those leakages come weeks or days later on.

Our plumbers in Albuquerque are qualified, experienced and fully-equipped to identify and repair your drain issue on the area.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
