<p>Ultraviolet disinfection systems use UV light to damage micro-organisms and offer cleansed water. The energy source required to heat the water is less costly. Calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions that trigger water hardness can be eliminated relatively quickly by using an ion exchange procedure. Basic water softeners are cation exchange devices. Cations refer to favorably charged ions liquified in the water. Cation exchange includes the replacement of the hardness ions with a nonhardness ion.</p>
<p>During the regrowth cycle, salt water (brackish water created in the brine tank by blending water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the design). As this brine travels through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are as a result sent out to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
