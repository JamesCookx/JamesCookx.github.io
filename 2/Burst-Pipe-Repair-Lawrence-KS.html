<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you see unusual popping, banging, or clanging sounds coming from your system, this could be a sign that sediment has built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating component.

To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>

Switch on the gas and examine connections for leaks by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mixture bubbles, you have a leak. Tighten up or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when ended up. Call the plumbing inspector to check out your work.

<p>Backflow preventers must only be fixed when the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum basic. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
