<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you do not scratch the sink. Seal the new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Photo 4. Plumber's putty can not be used on certain new sinks, but these will be labeled to that effect. If you can't use plumber's putty, use a non-water-based silicone. When you tighten up the locknut in place, excess putty will squeeze out in between the brand-new basket strainer and the sink. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to place the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without catching on the gasket.</p>
<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely happy with their service.</p>
