<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was established in the 1970s. It was in fact promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Sadly, any home that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook to take out hair and gunk. And in some cases even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and muttering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite sensible. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
