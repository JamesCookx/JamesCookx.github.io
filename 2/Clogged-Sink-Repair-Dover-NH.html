<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Dover NH</h3>
<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are commonly used in industrial plants, cooling towers, laboratories, laundries, swimming pools, sprinkler system systems, and fire sprinkler systems. Pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve developed to close with the aid of a spring when water circulation stops. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, avoiding non-potable water from being siphoned back into the potable system. The assembly consists of durable, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
