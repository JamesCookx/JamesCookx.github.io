Things of this size can get stuck in your pipes resulting in a clog which will will ultimately trigger sewer line damage.

This procedure continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll notice small amounts of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely regenerated.</p>
