<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will collect.</p>
<p>Sadly, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it typically becomes corrosive. Corrosive water triggers leaching of copper pipes and faucet fixtures, particularly in areas where water sits for long periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the green and blue spots being left in your bathroom and laundry room sinks. Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with unique venting systems also are readily available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't handle them here.</p>
