While the time required will differ based on the house size and the variety of found malfunctions, it's best to reserve approximately two hours when you schedule an inspection.

If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely hurried the job (unless you have a very little plumbing system). Ask how long the inspection normally takes when you call to arrange your consultation.</p>
