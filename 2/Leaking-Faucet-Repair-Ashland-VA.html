The paired check valves are set up in line with the pipeline and operate independently of each other. A set of 4 test cocks allow the operator to analyze the valves and make certain they are not being required open by accumulated debris.

<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Ashland VA</h3>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test information implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
