The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>
