<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to supply sodas drinks. Many, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water enters contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a threat to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code needs that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a minimized pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping consisting of copper shall be set up downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies providing carbonators.</p>

<p>Professional drain cleaning and plumbing stoppage service might appear like a waste of cash. Why invest in professional drain repair service when a chemical drain cleaner will do the trick? While chemical drain cleaners may be an inexpensive service, the extreme active ingredients rust your inner drain pipe, in time, developing vulnerable points in the pipe that are most likely to rupture. Dealing with repairing a burst pipe is certainly not worth the cost savings incurred from using a chemical drain cleaner.</p>

Frequently, if you have numerous drain problems you might have a drain line break someplace in your house or along your drain line to the sewer system. The camera can locate and recognize the issue so the drain can be repaired.</p>
