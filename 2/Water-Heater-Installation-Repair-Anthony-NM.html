<p>Cured-in place piping is a technique utilized to repair trenchless relining systems. Professional sewer and drain companies like Roto-Rooter have the ability to from another location line the area of the pipe that is cracked without needing to dig a trench. After the interior of the pipe is cleaned and dried, the installers will apply the lining to the problem area. The liner is treated in place with jets of hot steam as it molds into all the fractures inside the pipe.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, shut off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, inspect the instructions. After mounting the valve (Image 6), connect the fill tube (Photo 7).</p>
