<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Frostproof FL</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you need to work with a plumber for that burner kit. The total repair expense may remain in the $300 range. A gas hot water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Go for the brand-new heater. To guarantee that we are providing premium work and customer peace of mind, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and completely trained to securely carry out water heater replacements.
