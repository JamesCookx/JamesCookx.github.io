Lots of clogs are caused by putting excessive toilet paper into the bowl. Know how much toilet tissue your toilet can efficiently rid the bowl of per flush. Never ever place any paper product into the toilet bowl besides toilet paper. Paper towels can quickly stop up the toilet drain line or cause a clog further down the drain. Feminine health products must be disposed of in the trash and never ever in the toilet.</p>
<p>Water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the essential repairs only to deal with another problem quickly afterwards. Always continue to run water throughout and after using your disposal. Ideally, flushing it with cold water for 30 seconds after the waste has disappeared down the drain. The flywheel is jammed: If the disposal hums when you flip the switch, however it does not grind up food, this suggests the flywheel is stuck. Attempt freeing the jam by placing a hex wrench of the appropriate size into the hole on the bottom of the waste disposal unit. At the same time, you can prod the flywheel by sticking a broom handle (not your fingers!) into the sink.</p>
