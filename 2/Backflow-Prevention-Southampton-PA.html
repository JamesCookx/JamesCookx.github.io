By changing to a tankless design, you'll take pleasure in limitless warm water, smaller utility bills and more area in your utility closet. There are lots of reasons to go tankless.

<p>Backflow prevention procedures should be preserved on-site at all times during construction. Short-lived water will be enabled after the contractor sets up a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker should be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker need to be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser needs to be securely attached to strong rebar or wood stake to add structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection in between the water meter and the structure plumbing before the structure is significantly complete is forbidden unless a double check backflow assembly is installed and instantly tested to guarantee it is working.</p>
