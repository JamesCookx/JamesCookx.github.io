<p>Salt-free systems will also lower scale buildup and supply brighter clothing and softer skin using a healthier method. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to include salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and eco-friendly system. Conventional salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative impact on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem. Some cities are beginning to ban salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no waste water, no electrical energy and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are exceptionally low maintenance because the media can last as much as five years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be renewed on a month-to-month basis.</p>

Salt-free softeners are also referred to as water conditioners since they do not actually soften" the water; They condition (or neutralize) it. And since these kinds of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
