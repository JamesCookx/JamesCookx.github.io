Sometimes drain repair requirements can be solved reasonably quickly by an experienced handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain might need to be disassembled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. In many cases, a handyman might determine that a replacement part is needed (like a reducer, pvc, or tailpiece  trap) to guarantee regular operation for your drain.
