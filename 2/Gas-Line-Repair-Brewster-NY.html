<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are typically set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is greater than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly kept for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
