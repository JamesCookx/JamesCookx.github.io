<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to learn what a reasonable and fair price would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening refers to the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The result is water that's been successfully softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up tough water.</p>
