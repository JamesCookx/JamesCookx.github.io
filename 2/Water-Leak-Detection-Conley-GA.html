<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be removed by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are offered if the resin has actually already been fouled. Again, it is recommended to inspect the producer's instructions for special safety measures.</p>
<p>Since they're less vulnerable to rust, stainless steel blades are typically chosen. Other good alternatives are overload security, which turns off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to prevent jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the unclean meals get ground up in the disposal. And if your house is on a septic system, you'll need a disposal specifically designed to be used with a septic system. gives an introduction 1 of garbage disposals and septic systems.</p>
