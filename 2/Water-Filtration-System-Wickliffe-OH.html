<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach laid out above. Because the baffle efficiently cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically real when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and after that change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's reasonably friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
