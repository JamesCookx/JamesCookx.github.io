<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal.

Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever is in good shape.</p>
