If your unit is outlet-ready-- take notice of this part-- make certain your disposal switch is in the off" position prior to you plug the brand-new unit in. While it's not likely that having a disposal launch while your head is pressed versus it will result in decapitation, it might scare a number of years off your life. Not that I would understand from experience. When to repair: Under no situations should your toilet relocation when you sit or push on it.

If the brand-new unit's outlet is lower, you must also decrease the tee that the discharge pipe links to. Loosen up the 2 nuts that link the tee to the tailpiece above and the trap listed below. Attempt lowering the tee to see if the tailpiece is long enough. You'll have to replace it with one that's a little longer if it's not.</p>
