<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can if it can quickly and rapidly be dealt with through the sink.

<p>There are two popular install systems utilized for garbage disposers: the basic 3-bolt mount (if you have actually had actually a disposer set up for some time, it's probably mounted by doing this) and a newer system called the "EZ Mount" by Waste King (Insinkerator has a comparable system called "Quick Lock"). Each achieve the very same job with little distinction, aside from their installation. As the name implies, the EZ Mount system is meant to be much easier to handle when repairing an unit or installing.</p>

Other good options are overload security, which shuts off the motor if it begins to get too hot; an auto-reverse function to avoid jamming; and a dishwasher-drain connection so food particles from the dirty dishes get ground up in the disposal. And if your home is on a septic tank, you'll need a disposal particularly developed to be used with a septic system. provides an overview 1 of garbage disposals and septic tanks.</p>
