<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this large quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A garbage disposal works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without restraining water flow. By installing a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by conserving the quantity of garbage that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a waste disposal unit the trash is managed through currently existing water facilities.</p>

Each achieve the exact same job with little difference, aside from their installation. As the name indicates, the EZ Mount mechanism is planned to be easier to deal with when repairing a system or installing.</p>
<p>Metal-on-metal grinding noise-you know something's wrong when you flip the switch to turn on the garbage disposal and all you get is a hum-or a loud.
