<p>A water solidity test would not show a reduced firmness. How do I know it's working? The FutureSoft is a salt-free system that does not pull out the hardness to replace them with sodium. The hardness minerals, calcium and magnesium are still present and being taken shape. You will no longer have the downside to difficult water, i.e., scaling, obstructing and etching of aerators while maintaining the useful minerals. Likewise, because the minerals are not being pulled out of the water, you will not be reducing the pH, which can trigger water to end up being acidic helping it to remain alkaline which is extremely useful for you and your house.</p>
