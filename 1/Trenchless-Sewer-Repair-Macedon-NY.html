<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best first experience with the beginning of our home improvements. George and Anthony did an amazing job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our particular needs for our home. I will always use them and ask for George particularly for all future problems or repairs. They were prompt and provided excellent prices for what we needed done. I highly advise this company for all your plumbing needs.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>When there are fractures or holes in your sewer line, sewer line repair is advised. If damage is serious, replacement of the line is recommended. These are all signs that your system ought to be checked by a plumber. We don't suggest attempting to repair this specific home appliance on your own, because it does provide a security threat, due to the sharp blades that are used to chop and grind waste. Because these chemicals will just harm the home appliance even more, you ought to also prevent utilizing any type of chemical drain cleaners on your garbage disposal.</p>
