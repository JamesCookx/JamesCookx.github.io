It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional use, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain as well as preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is very crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.  Think of this device as a frost-proof hose bibb with a vacuum breaker.  It also has to be located at least 6 inches above any overflow rim or downstream piping.</p>

<p>During the regeneration cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the brine tank by mixing water and salt) is gone through the resin tank (either up or down depending on the style). As this brine passes through the tank, sodium ions are moved (exchanged) for the firmness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are as a result sent to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe small amounts of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered completely restored.</p>
