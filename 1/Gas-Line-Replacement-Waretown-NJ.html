This process involves coating Epoxy lining to the interiors of pipes to prevent leaks and deterioration within the line. The epoxy forms a barrier between the within the material and the pipe flowing through it. This repair method is preferable for pipes that are not made from galvanized metals.

<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Many water softeners utilize an ion exchange procedure where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are fulfilled, and the system will need to have the salt in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
