<p>For whole-house repiping, the option typically boils down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is long lasting and less expensive than copper. PEX is simple to install, which suggests the cost of installation might be low too. There is some risk of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is unusual. In general, it's an affordable service that will stand the test of time. We often recommend this material, though it will depend.</p>
