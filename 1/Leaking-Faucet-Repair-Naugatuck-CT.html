<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Services Naugatuck CT</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump shuts off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or at least minimize, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
