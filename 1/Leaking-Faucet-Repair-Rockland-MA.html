<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale buildup and offer brighter clothes and softer skin utilizing a healthier technique. The main benefit with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable result on people with high-blood pressure and heart disease. Some cities are beginning to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium material in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance totally free and utilize no waste water, no salt and no electricity or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance due to the fact that the media can last approximately five years without replacing. Salt-based systems need the salt to be replenished on a regular monthly basis.</p>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
