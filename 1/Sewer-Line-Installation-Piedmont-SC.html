<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes at Piedmont SC</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Lubrication may aid with the placement of some parts within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lube does not assist the assembly work any much better, it is just there to help the technician assemble the elements into the body without creating damage from friction.
