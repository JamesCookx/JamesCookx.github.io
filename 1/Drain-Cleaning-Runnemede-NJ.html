<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adjust to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line.
