<p>Backflow is water streaming in the opposite direction from its normal circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water flowing to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "normal," the instructions of water circulation can be reversed. This produces a backflow condition and the potential for contaminated water going into the drinkable water distribution system. Copper is a biostatic product, which implies germs will not grow on it. Copper has been utilized (in addition to PVC pipes) since the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old structures. It is specifically beneficial for cold and hot faucet water and refrigerant lines in HEATING AND COOLING systems.</p>
<p>Galvanized steel safe and clean water supply and circulation pipes are commonly found with small pipe sizes from 3‚ÅÑ8 inch (9.5 mm) to 2 inches (51 mm).

Steel pipe has National Pipe Thread (NPT) basic tapered male threads, which get in touch with female tapered threads on elbows, tees, couplers, valves, and other fittings. Galvanized steel (typically recognized simply as "galv" or "iron" in the plumbing trade) is relatively expensive, and tough to work with due to weight and requirement of a pipe threader It stays in typical use for repair of existing "galv" systems and to satisfy building code non-combustibility requirements typically found in hotels, apartment buildings and other commercial applications. It is also extremely long lasting and resistant to mechanical abuse. Black lacquered steel pipe is the most extensively used pipe product for fire sprinklers and natural gas.</p>
