<p>Search for a jam. Something too hard to grind, such as a piece of glass, could be jamming the motor. Switch off the power and water, then unplug the disposal (If it's hardwired, shut off the breaker.) Get rid of the rubber baffle inside the drain-most just raise out-and shine a flashlight into the hole. Fish out the blockage with a pair of tongs or needle-nose pliers.

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the previous if I turned off the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
