<p>While the "Big 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of the majority of repairs, there are a lot of other small toilet parts that must also be well maintained to assist prevent leaks and other toilet problems. For instance, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leaks in between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to break and harden or just be so squished that it does not fill the space in addition to it utilized to, and you end up with water all over the location. Just like with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so worn that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly advise also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in great shape.</p>
