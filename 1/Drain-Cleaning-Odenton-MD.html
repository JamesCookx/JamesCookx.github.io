<p>Changing or installing a brand-new waste disposal unit can be an inconvenience, as it includes the uncomfortable, restricted workspace under your sink. You'll also need to be comfortable with plumbing and electrical, as it involves both. For this factor, we strongly advise calling a pro to get the job done. At Genz-Ryan, we've been in the business of helping Minnesota property owners for over 60 years. We provide a variety of InSinkErator Â® garbage disposals to satisfy your private needs, or we can install whatever waste disposal unit you supply us.</p>
<p>A leaking toilet is another typical problem homeowners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than most likely means your toilet has a leak. This issue is often triggered by a corroded pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a broken flapper valve. A drip pan is efficient and affordable. The drip pan is set up under the water heater in order to collect any extraneous leaking water. The drip pan can be piped to drain the water outside the house or into an ideal drain. A perfect time to install a drip or replace pan is when the hot water heater is being replaced.</p>
