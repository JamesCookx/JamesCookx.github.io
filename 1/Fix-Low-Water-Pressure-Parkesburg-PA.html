<p>Soft drink dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas drinks. Lots of, if not most, pipes are made from copper. When carbonated water comes into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate solution (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has actually been shown to be a danger to the digestive system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the approved backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a decreased pressure backflow assembly (RPZ). Extra requirements: no piping including copper shall be installed downstream of the RPZ backflow assemblies supplying carbonators.</p>

<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are some of the most crucial functions of a company. Clients can leave your company with an unfavorable impression if urinals and toilets don't operate appropriately.

<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and journey lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are plenty of other little toilet parts that need to also be well preserved to help prevent leakages and other toilet problems. For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense against leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and split or simply be so crushed that it does not fill the area as well as it utilized to, and you wind up with water all over the place. Much like with the gasket, sometimes your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being rusty or so used that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly recommend also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure whatever remains in tip-top shape.</p>
