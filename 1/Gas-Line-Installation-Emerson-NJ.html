<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately test a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the second line of defense fails (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance could take place. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
