<p>A water softener has a resin tank including thousands of tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. When freshly regrowed, the beads become loaded with sodium ions from the water softener salt. As tough water travels through the water softener system, the calcium and magnesium ions are drawn in to the resin beads. There, sodium ions are exchanged for the hard water ions. The softener system then provides soft water for your usage. Difficult water causes gray or white deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be utilized to decrease these symptoms.</p>
