When tough water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
