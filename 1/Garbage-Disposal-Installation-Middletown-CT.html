<p>There are different products used in re-piping, in water supply re-piping some of the materials are metal and perhaps some plastic pipes. The metal pipes are galvanized steel or iron, brass, and copper. The plastic pipes are Poly Vinyl Chloride PVC, Chlorine Poly Vinyl Chloride CPVC, Poly Ethylene PE, Polybutylene PB, and Kitec. The majority of these plastic pipe systems will end in lawsuits. Part of the issue is with the fittings that are typically inexpensively made with little quality assurance by a verity of overseas companies. Plastic pipes likewise have questionable signing up with methods. Plastic pipes are glued, crimped, and banded. When plastic pipes blow a joint they blow apart and result in water damage. Plastics end up being breakable with age and heat. There are likewise issues about the molecular structure of plastics and the resins from which they are made.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in specific areas, based upon our experience.</p>
