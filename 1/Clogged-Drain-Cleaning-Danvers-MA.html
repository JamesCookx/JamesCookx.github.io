<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than utilize the approach set out above. Due to the fact that the baffle effectively halves the interior size of the tee, it's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up. When the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap, this is especially real. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

Also permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an annually test. It is required that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the irrigation system.
