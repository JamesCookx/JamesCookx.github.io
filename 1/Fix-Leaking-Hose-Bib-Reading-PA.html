<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has two check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow scenario. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the very first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow situation could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
