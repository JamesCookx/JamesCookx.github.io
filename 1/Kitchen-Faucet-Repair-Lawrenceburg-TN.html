<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
