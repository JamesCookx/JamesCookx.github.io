<p>While the "Huge 4" - fill valve, flush valve, flapper, and trip lever - tend to be the main focus of many repairs, there are lots of other little toilet parts that should also be well preserved to help avoid leakages and other toilet troubles. For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leaks between the tank and bowl. As it gets worn, it can begin to harden and break or just be so crushed that it does not fill the space in addition to it used to, and you end up with water all over the place. Similar to with the gasket, often your tank to bowl washers and bolts can become rusty or so used that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest likewise replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in good shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
