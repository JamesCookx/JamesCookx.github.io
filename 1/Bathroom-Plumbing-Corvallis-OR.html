<p>Lastly, the most complex and sophisticated backflow preventer is the lowered pressure zone device. This device consists of no less than 5 individually operating valves (two check valves and a differential relief valve sealed off at both ends by water tight valves). Each valve functions as a back up system to the other four. Throughout basic water streams at style pressure, the 2 check valves stay open and the relief valve is closed. The relief valve will spring open if either check valve is clogged and wedged open by particles or if siphonage occurs to the linked service pipeline. To prevent backflow, the downstream check valve will close. Such a reliable and advanced (if pricey) device is best utilized in vital areas where cross contamination might be a direct danger to life and health.</p>
<p>Gas lines undoubtedly need repairs-- age and use will eventually wear them down.
