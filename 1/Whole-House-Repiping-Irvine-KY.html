<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Irvine KY</h3>
<p>Take an example: Say the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner kit. The overall repair bill may remain in the $300 range. A gas water heater (not counting miscellaneous plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric hot water heater cost about $400 to $800). That repair bill is nearly half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyway. Go for the brand-new heater. To ensure that we are offering high-quality work and customer assurance, all our plumbers are background-checked, licensed, bonded, and thoroughly trained to safely carry out water heater replacements. In addition to standard water heaters, we also install tankless water heaters, and heatpump water heaters.</p>
