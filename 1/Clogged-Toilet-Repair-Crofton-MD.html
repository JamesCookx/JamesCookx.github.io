If you live in an older house (built pre-1970) or any house with galvanized steel plumbing, this is a choice to think about.

<p>In spite of the Romans' common usage of lead pipes, their aqueducts hardly ever poisoned people. Unlike other parts of the world where lead pipes cause poisoning, the Roman water had a lot calcium in it that a layer of plaque prevented the water contacting the lead itself. What typically causes confusion is the large amount of proof of widespread lead poisoning, particularly among those who would have had easy access to piped water, 19 an unfortunate result of lead being used in cookware and as an additive to processed food and drink (for instance as a preservative in red wine). 20 Roman lead pipe inscriptions provided information on the owner to avoid water theft.</p>
<p>Many homeowners schedule a yearly plumbing inspection to stay up to date with preventive maintenance and ensure that the home's plumbing remains in good working order.

<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. Some of those thin areas leak right now and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up requiring to be properly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
