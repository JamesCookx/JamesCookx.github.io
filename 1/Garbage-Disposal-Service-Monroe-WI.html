<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow situation.

If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense fails (both examine valves fail to hold), a backflow circumstance might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company thinks about high risk" establishments.</p>
