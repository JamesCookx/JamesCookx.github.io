<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, generally in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Because water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain roughly constant, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate surpasses supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
