<h3>Plumbing And Water Heater Repair Geneva IL</h3>
<p>Take an example: State the your heater is 8 years of ages and you have to hire a plumber for that burner set. The total repair expense might remain in the $300 variety. A gas water heater (not counting various plumbing parts) costs $400 to $1200 (electric water heaters cost about $400 to $800). That repair expense is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Opt for the brand-new heater.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can position problems.</p>
