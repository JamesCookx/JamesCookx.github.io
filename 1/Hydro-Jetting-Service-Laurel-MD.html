<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be proper if health or ecological factors necessitate limiting salt. In time, the beads become covered with minerals and have to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has 3 cycles: backwash, rinse and recharge. The regrowth process can be set up automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger certainly does not suggest much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller beads that in fact provide more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to permit maximum capacity in a minimum of space. Plus, our trademarked Directional Flow Screen system helps guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regrowth to release solidity, sediment and dirt.</p>
