The minimum approved backflow prevention assembly for unlisted hazards will be identified on a case-by-case basis by the Cross Connection Control Program.</p>
<p>Gas lines inevitably need repairs-- age and use will ultimately use them down. Though normal, it's still demanding to a house owner, who may fear the hassle of hiring a service professional to manage their (potentially) costly repairs rapidly and effectively.
