<p>Backflow prevention gadgets are developed to secure the public water supply from cross-connections. A modern neighborhood water supply system is designed to ensure that water streams to residential or commercial properties and buildings under pressure. If there is a cross-connection between the water supply and a contaminated source, this community water network includes numerous users where there is a threat to public health.
