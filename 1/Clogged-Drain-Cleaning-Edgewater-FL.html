<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: Among the very first most obvious signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a larger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. No matter whether it is an electrical water heater or a gas water heater, Premier Plumbing has actually supplied hot water heater repair and installation service in the Hampton Roadways area since 1978.</p>
