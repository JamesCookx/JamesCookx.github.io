A high level danger is specified as a scenario in which the water backflow could seriously damage individuals. In some cities, these valves should be evaluated when a year by a certified technician.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) utilize carbonated water blended under pressure with syrup and water to provide soft drinks drinks. Numerous, if not most, pipes are made of copper. When carbonated water enters into contact with copper it chemically liquifies the copper from the pipe. This copper-carbonate option (i.e. Carbonic Acid) has been proven to be a danger to the gastrointestinal system. The Universal Plumbing Code requires that the authorized backflow prevention for a post-mix carbonator be a lowered pressure backflow assembly (RPZ).

<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses provided after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly should be checked each year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for lawn irrigation systems require an annually test. It is required that this assembly is checked in the spring before operating the irrigation system. All testable backflow preventers must be checked each year to insure the safety of the potable drinking water in your house.
