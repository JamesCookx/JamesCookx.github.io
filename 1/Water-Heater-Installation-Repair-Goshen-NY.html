<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Normally, this process includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
