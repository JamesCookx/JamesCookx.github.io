However while little drips should not be cause for issue, house owners ought to keep an eye on the hot water heater leaks. All significant plumbing code bodies deal with protection against backflow in potable water supply systems. All potential or existing cross connections should be protected from backflow by the installation of a correct backflow prevention device. Consult Public Health for more particular info on code requirements.</p>
