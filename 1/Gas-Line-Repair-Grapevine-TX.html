<p>It's a good idea to check your backflow assembly every spring when you turn your irrigation system on. However, we hardly ever recommend CPVC when a whole home needs repiping. The pipes can become fragile, gradually, and may require replacement quicker than hoped. Some states need pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may also need a special license to work on gas lines. Licensing normally needs a test or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for more information.</p>

Depending upon the level of care and maintenance carried out on it, your water heater will last between 10-15 years. After that, you may start to see a lapse in effectiveness.
