<p>Pipeline leak detection is utilized to figure out if and in some cases where a leak has happened in systems which contain liquids and gases. Most steamfitters, plumbers, and pipefitters discover their trade through a 4- or 5-year apprenticeship. Apprentices usually get 2,000 hours of paid on-the-job training, as well as some technical guideline, each year. Technical guideline consists of safety, local plumbing codes and policies, and blueprint reading. Apprentices also study mathematics, used physics, and chemistry. Apprenticeship programs are sponsored by unions, trade associations, and organisations. Many apprentices get in a program directly, but some start as helpers or complete a pre-apprenticeship training programs in plumbing and other trades.</p>
