<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually test a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might happen. That is why this kind of valve is not specified for what a public utility considers high danger" facilities.</p>
