<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
<p>Where the company lies: Beware of contractors who offer you a post office box without any street address or usage just an answering service. If he or she pressures you to hire fast and pay money up front, never ever hire somebody who comes unsolicited to your door and can't supply you proof of certifications-- especially. Grey = End-User Pressure - water presses past the # 2 check valve into the system of the end user. The # 2 Check avoids backflow caused by pressure boosts in the down stream plumbing.</p>
