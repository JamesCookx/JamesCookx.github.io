<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, normally between and aqueduct and the distribution water pipe. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Given that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than demand (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is safely and easily saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
