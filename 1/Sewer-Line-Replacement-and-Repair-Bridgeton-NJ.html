<p>I wished to thank Clog Dawg Plumbing for the very best 1st experience with the beginning of our house improvements. George and Anthony did an incredible job for us. They exceeded and beyond any expectations that we had. They also worked around our specific requirements for our home. I will always utilize them and ask for George specifically for all future issues or repairs. They were timely and provided excellent pricing for what we required done. I highly suggest this company for all your plumbing requires.</p>
<p>The term hard water" may seem like an oxymoron, but it's just household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. These minerals don't make water unhealthy to consume. They also are relatively undetectable through odor or taste, however they can be harmful just the same. As with our trenchless services, we will first perform pipe leak tests using video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Bath tubs and toilets are made from porcelain due to the fact that it's water resistant, sanitary, and long lasting Sadly, however, porcelain isn't perfect-it can split. Even if your toilet isn't leaking now, hairline cracks and fractures grow, due to the fact that even a small fracture compromises the resistance of the entire structure. We've described the procedure we recommend for finding a great plumber. Now let's look at the services an excellent plumber must offer. A gas line installation job requires a specific skill-set to fit the line properly. Property owners can discover local-contractors with solid track records who can do a good task and charge affordable compared to big contractors. When installed have the gas lines examined every year to see if there are any gas leakages.</p>
