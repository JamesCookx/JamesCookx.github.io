<p>To assist prevent blockages within the tee (a consequence of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the approach laid out above. Since the baffle effectively halves the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is specifically true when the waste must take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee enables a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
