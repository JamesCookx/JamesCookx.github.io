<p>Yes, certified and licensed plumbers can make installation and repair modifications to the gas piping system. Sinks must be thought of like a machine.

Like any machine, a sink has numerous parts that need maintenance and repair over time. A plumbing authorization provides for three inspections. Extra inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections called in on work not finished, not effectively installed, or on an unattainable property will require re-inspection. It is the authorization holder's responsibility to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the home.</p>
