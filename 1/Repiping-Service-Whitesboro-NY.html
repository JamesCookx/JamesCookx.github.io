<p>Potassium chloride is more pricey and adheres more strongly to the resin, minimizing the exchange efficiency when compared to salt chloride. About 10 percent more potassium chloride salt is used during the backflush operation. What we suggest is that your toilet is old. Older toilets might work just fine, however if your toilet is actually old (and outdated in design), you may wish to think about a toilet replacement service by Vegas Valley Plumbing. Modern toilets are energy-efficient and conserve water when you flush, which not only is great for the environment, but it's good for your wallet as well.

You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
