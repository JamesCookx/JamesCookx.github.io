<p>To help avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will link the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the technique laid out above. Due to the fact that the baffle successfully cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is particularly real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge directly down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's relatively friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>

Demand-control models, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, normally restore after so many gallons of water have been softened. If you have a changing water use schedule, such models are convenient.</p>
