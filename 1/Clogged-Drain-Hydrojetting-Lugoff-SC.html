<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Lugoff SC</h3>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An approved, properly installed and preserved backflow assembly essentially eliminates the danger of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric hot water heater have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any substantial modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater may last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly vulnerable to repeating pinhole leaks (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping.

All leaks, broken fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
