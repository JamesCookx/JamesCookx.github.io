<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Because water need differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately consistent, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (generally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
