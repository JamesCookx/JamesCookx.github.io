<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water adopted the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential licenses issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire lawn sprinkler. The assembly was checked at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was connected. By code this backflow assembly must be checked every year. Also allows issued for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard watering systems need an every year test. It is needed that this assembly is tested in the spring prior to operating the watering system. All testable backflow preventers should be evaluated annually to insure the safety of the safe and clean drinking water in your house.
