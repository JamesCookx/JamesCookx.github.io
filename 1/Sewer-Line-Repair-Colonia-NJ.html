<p>When you eliminate the cap to flush out the valve, inspect the washer for wear or fractures. Changing a bad washer is inexpensive and simple. But finding the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in the house centers and hardware stores. Other styles can be hard to discover. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers generally replace the whole fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
