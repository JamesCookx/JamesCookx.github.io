Examine the sewer lines from property to suppress connection, septic system, and drainage systems to completely inspect if pipe damage, rust, or major clogs exist. Tree roots are among the greatest causes of a sewer line backup. As roots enter the drain line they can cause obstructions and back up into your house.</p>
<p>Blockages are easily prevented with a couple of key actions. Place drain strainers on all drains, if possible. These strainers capture hair, food and other debris before it gets stuck, avoiding the need of drain cleaning. Although they do not capture everything, it assists the system substantially.
