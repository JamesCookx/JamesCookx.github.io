The Supertech serviced our air conditioning unit and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition.

I would highly recommend Hunter for any issues you might have.</p>
<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other features that make it hard to access to in-wall pipes, think about at least changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets need to absolutely never ever wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural integrity of the home.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly.
