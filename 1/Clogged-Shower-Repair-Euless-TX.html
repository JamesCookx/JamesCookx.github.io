<p>Sediment Accumulation: If you discover odd popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element. Lacking warm water quickly is another indication of sediment accumulation, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to eliminate the tank.</p>
<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Look for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making a good seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and allow the drain and P-trap to fill with water.

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen up the other pipe connections, if essential, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the shop.

The proposal may be considered and authorized, if it fulfills the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
