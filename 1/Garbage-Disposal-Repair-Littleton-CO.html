<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
