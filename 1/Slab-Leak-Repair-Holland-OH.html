<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately constant, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess supply of water is securely and cleanly kept for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
