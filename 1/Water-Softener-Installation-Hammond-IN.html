<p>Blockages are quickly avoided with a couple of key actions. Location drain strainers on all drains, if possible.

Installing a tankless hot water heater is a higher in advance investment, but these systems can substantially cut the cost of monthly utilities.

<p>An rdc resembles a DC because it is a mechanical backflow preventer including 2 independently acting, spring-loaded check valves. Nevertheless, it usually does not include shutoff valves, might or might not be geared up with test dicks or ports, and is normally less reliable than a DC. An rdc works versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage but must be used to separate just nonhealth hazards and is intended for usage only in water service connections to single-family houses.</p>
