<p>Unfortunately, when water is totally removed of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being corrosive.

A lot of residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More pricey gas hot water heater with special venting systems likewise are available. But they're harder to install, and we will not handle them here.</p>
