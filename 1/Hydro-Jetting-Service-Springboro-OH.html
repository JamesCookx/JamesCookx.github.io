<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are usually set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers developed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later use when demand rate goes beyond supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and night).</p>
