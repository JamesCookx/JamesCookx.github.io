<p>Water that has been totally demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is hungry for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have been removed-- corrosive. For this reason, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not trigger this kind of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (primarily calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically sodium or in some cases potassium).</p>
