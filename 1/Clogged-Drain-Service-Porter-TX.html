The repair technician should take care to not create a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations to lower elevation. If the backflow prevention assembly was installed as a service security assembly, this backsiphonage condition could cause a contamination of the plumbing system. Abrams, Paul.

But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
