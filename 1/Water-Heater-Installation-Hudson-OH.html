Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
