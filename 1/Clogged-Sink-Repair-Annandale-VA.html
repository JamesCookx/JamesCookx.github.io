<p>The check assembly was developed in the 1950s for the fire protection market, producing a redundancy created to make sure that one check valve will continue to protect the city water supply even if the other fails. This assembly also allows the closure of one valve to reduce the pressure differential throughout the other, creating a more reliable seal and avoiding even minor backflow leakage. Test dicks, or small ball valves, make it possible for the attachment of testing equipment that examines whether the check assembly is practical.</p>
<p>Although the technician agreed that the customer did the right thing in her efforts to tighten up the pipes, the technician saw that the pipe had actually become exceptionally worn away over the years and that a PVC pipe may be much better matched for the customer's needs. He shut off the supply of water to the house, removed the corroded system and fit a PVC pipe in its place. Before leaving the home, the specialist restored water flow and evaluated the pipe.</p>
