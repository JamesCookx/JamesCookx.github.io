<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it should put something back into the water.

This tank is filled with resin beads, and the firmness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank replenished.</p>
