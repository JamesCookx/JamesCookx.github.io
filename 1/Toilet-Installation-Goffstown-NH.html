That repair costs is almost half the cost of the heater itself, and it's an old heater on its last legs anyhow. Choose the new heater.

Water, electricity, and gas are frequently dealt with when setting up these, and when managed improperly can be extremely unsafe. Our company can guarantee that your water heater is set up safely.
