<p>Leaks are sly. While the time required will differ based on the house size and the variety of found breakdowns, it's best to set aside approximately two hours when you arrange an inspection. There's constantly the chance that your plumber's previous job will run long and delay the beginning time. If the plumber finishes in 15 minutes, and dashes off to their next consultation, they likely rushed the task (unless you have a really little plumbing system). When you call to arrange your appointment, ask for how long the inspection normally takes.</p>

There is no chance of understanding whether you have a tree root problem without seeing it with a video camera inspection. You can chance and wait for the first downpour however I think you 'd rather not.</p>
