Water softeners typically have a life-span of 15 years, nevertheless, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately kept.

<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains.

You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can damage your pipes and trigger other leakages - so it deserves it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
