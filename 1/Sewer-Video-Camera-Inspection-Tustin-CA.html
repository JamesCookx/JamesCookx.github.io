But is a plumbing catastrophe impending or simply an issue for the distant future? Replacing old pipes in a 1,500 square foot, two-bathroom home expenses $4,000 to $10,000, and requires cutting open walls and floors, so you certainly don't want to do the job before it's essential.

<p>Eliminating or minimizing water firmness is done with a piece of equipment referred to as a water softener.  It is inside this softener where the ion exchange procedure takes place. A softener is consisted of various components, each having their own special purpose.

The brains of the softener depend on the control valve or softener head as it is commonly referred to. Most popular water softeners have an automated regenerating system.  The most standard type has an electrical timer that recharges the system and flushes on a routine schedule.</p>
