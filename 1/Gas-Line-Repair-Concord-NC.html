<p>Those of us in the market understand that cross-connection programs in many locations have greatly lowered the variety of reported events that happen within our water systems. This has at times led to people thinking that backflow concerns and problems no longer exist or that there might never ever really have actually been a problem in the first location. This thinking can be both dangerous and detrimental. Backflow events in water systems are an outcome of modifications in pressure within that system.  Every system may not need a lowered pressure principle backflow assembly.  In far a lot of areas we have an all or absolutely nothing method to backflow security. We need to take a look at each installation for the hazard it provides and after that install the correct security.</p>
