<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Covington GA</h3>
<p>Caution: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is used on many rural houses that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water supply. The possibility of water spitting, and the amount of water that spits out, both boost with a longer mainline on the irrigation system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline in between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve set up, however for the most part it ought to be much less water.</p>
