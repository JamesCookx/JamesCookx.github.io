If pushing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under typical pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and after that run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. If you feel mineral deposits, clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad. Don't utilize anything that might roughen it. You need to replace the flapper if cleaning the flush valve seat doesn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it needs to put something back into the water. Most water softeners use an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for sodium ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the solidity ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when specific levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the salt water tank renewed.</p>
