<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. But to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) connect themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the sodium in the brine tank replenished.</p>
