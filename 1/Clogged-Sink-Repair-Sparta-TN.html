<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are generally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are facilities designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered flow regulators rather than water storage systems. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source stay approximately consistent, usage never ever exactly matches supply. As so for those periods where water circulation is higher than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
