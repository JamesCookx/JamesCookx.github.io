<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  process filters the water through an exchange media called resin or zeolite. Usually, the resin is a natural or synthetic, sand-like product coated with favorably charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is created. The water streams through the unit while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now thought about soft.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention steps need to be maintained on-site at all times during construction. Short-lived water will be enabled after the contractor installs a hose bibb assembly including a vertical PVC riser at the water meter with a hose bibb on a 90-degree elbow at the top.  A vacuum breaker need to be attached to the hose bibb at all times.  The discharge opening from the vacuum breaker should be at least 12 inches above grade.  The riser should be firmly connected to tough rebar or wood stake to include structural stability to the assembly.  The direct connection between the water meter and the structure plumbing prior to the structure is substantially complete is restricted unless a double check backflow assembly is set up and instantly evaluated to guarantee it is working.</p>
