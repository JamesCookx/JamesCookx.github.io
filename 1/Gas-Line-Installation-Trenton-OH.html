<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two individually acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve. It includes shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. An RPBA is effective versus backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be utilized to separate health or non-health threats.</p>
