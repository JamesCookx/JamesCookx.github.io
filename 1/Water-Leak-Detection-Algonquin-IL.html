Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be tested periodically to ensure they are operating properly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with effectively calibrated gauge equipment.</p>
