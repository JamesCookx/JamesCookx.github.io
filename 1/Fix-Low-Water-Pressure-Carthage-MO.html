A waste disposal unit can reduce a house's total garbage output by pulverizing most common food scraps so they can be gotten rid of through the sink as wastewater. A garbage disposal fits essentially effortlessly into the sink, and can be kept by simply dealing with a few ice and some baking soda once a month to sharpen the blades and reduce unpleasant odors.</p>
