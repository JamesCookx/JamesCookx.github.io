Replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be suitable if health or ecological reasons demand limiting salt. Over time, the beads become coated with minerals and need to be cleaned.

The regrowth process can be scheduled immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>

<p>Hard water stops washing cleaning agents and cosmetic cleansers from working as efficiently.
