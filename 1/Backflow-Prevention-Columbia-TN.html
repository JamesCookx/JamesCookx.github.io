<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly.
