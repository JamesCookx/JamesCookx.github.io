<p>Your primary step is to turn off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you don't have a shutoff, switch off the water system at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your house. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Picture 6). A flexible supply line reinforced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in the house centers and hardware shops. Photos 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Photo 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we show, check the directions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>Keep in mind, it is essential that you do not put just anything down your waste disposal unit unit. While such units are tough devices, they are not blenders.

Whether you've unintentionally damaged your garbage disposal unit, or it has actually just struggled with wear and tear for many years, we can take care of the needed repairs. Our garbage disposal repair technicians can identify any issue that may occur with your unit, and we can help you pick between repair and replacement.
