With a hot water heater replacement, you'll solve your repair problems, and have improved water heater efficiency also. The salt uptake through softened water depends on the solidity of the water. Averagely, less than 3% sodium uptake originates from consuming softened water. Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back.</p>

For this factor, WQA suggests that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be utilized downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is just recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations in the process (typically salt or often potassium).</p>
