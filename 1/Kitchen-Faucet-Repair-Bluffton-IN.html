<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between different metals will initiate the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created because of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the 2 metals.</p>
