By crushing food waste-- modern-day waste disposal unit do not actually use blades - it's processed by water treatment facilities where the small particulates are easily filtered out and turned into strong fertilizer, which, in turn, can be offered to lower the total costs of treatment.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. The majority of houses use continuous feed disposals, which implies the disposal will work as long as it is turned on. When a lot of work is to be done in the kitchen, this is convenient. Batch disposals have a holding tank that accumulates waste up until it is full and is then triggered when the lid is closed. Our plumbers can help you choose which kind of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
