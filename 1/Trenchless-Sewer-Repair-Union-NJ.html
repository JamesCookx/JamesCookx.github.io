<p>Your old discharge tube probably won't be the right length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and cut it with a hacksaw for your waste disposal unit installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if needed, to place television back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too short, you might have to make a time-wasting journey to the shop. To prevent this, ensure the brand-new waste disposal unit installation set consists of a tube, or purchase one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>

Polyvinylchloride pipes or PVC pipes are frequently used for the main supply of water to your house along with the home sinks, toilet, and bathtub drain lines or vent stacks.
