<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most typical kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- two layers of backflow security. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. When you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance could occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility thinks about high danger" establishments.</p>
