It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the disadvantage shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air should be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.

Prior to leaving the house, the service technician restored water flow and checked the pipe.</p>
