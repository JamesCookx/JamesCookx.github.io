Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
