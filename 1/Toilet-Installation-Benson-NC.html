For commercial residential or commercial property, the District evaluates the use of each brand-new tenant. If the current backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made before water service is permitted. Cost for the device is covered by either the home or the tenant owner.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of disposals: batch feed and continuous feed. Many homes use constant feed disposals, which means the disposal will work as long as it is turned on. This is handy when a lot of work is to be done in the kitchen. When the lid is closed, batch disposals have a holding tank that builds up waste till it is complete and is then triggered. Our plumbers can help you choose which kind of disposal will work best for your sink.</p>
