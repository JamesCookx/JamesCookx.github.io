<p>Only a plumber with experience in repiping can tell you that you need brand-new pipes. However, there are some signs that you may need pipe repair services-- or an overall pipe replacement. While other things may be to blame, call a plumbing company right away if you see any of the following issues. Recurring pipe leakages might be an indication that it is time to replace the entire system.

<p>How does ion exchange work? A physical and chemical  procedure filters the water through an exchange media referred to as resin or zeolite. Normally, the resin is a synthetic or natural , sand-like product covered with positively charged sodium ions. As the calcium and magnesium liquifies into favorably charged ions, an ion exchange environment is developed. The water flows through the system while the resin launches its sodium ions and easily trades them for the calcium and magnesium ions. The water flowing out of the device is now considered soft.</p>
