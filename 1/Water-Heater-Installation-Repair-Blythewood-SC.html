<p>City water pipe supply water for many houses and buildings, consisting of the water used in fire protection systems. However the stagnant water that fills the pipes of wet fire defense systems is non-potable"-- it's not fit to consume. Thus, water authorities frequently need homeowner to install backflow preventers to keep stagnant water from mixing with the treated, drinkable" water in the city water supply. Garbage disposals are an important part of a smoothly operating kitchen. You need to be diligent about not letting food go down the drain if you don't currently have one.

They are non-testable and are generally used by public utility and installed after a water meter to avoid the meter from running backwards and low defense against backflow.
