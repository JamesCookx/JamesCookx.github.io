<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a common plumbing problem, and many clogs can be resolved with an easy fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the easy unclogging techniques don't work to solve the slow drain, the problem can be a much deeper blockage somewhere in the main sewer line. Unfortunately, mainline clogs are usually much bigger blockages than require more than easy unclogging approaches, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the problem.</p>
<p>Are rust or minerals building up in your water? The two dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they gradually begin to constrict the flow of water, resulting in low water pressure. It takes a very long time for this much accumulation to take place, so by the time you discover it, it may be time to repipe. Red or brown water results when bits of rust break off from the pipes into your supply of water, impacting your water quality.</p>

While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a problem-- for its many designated usages around your house.</p>
