While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

Softeners do not remove the TDS and do not cause this type of deterioration A softener is merely recording some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (typically salt or sometimes potassium).</p>
