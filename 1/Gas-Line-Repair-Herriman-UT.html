Mechanical gauges utilized to determine test pressures shall have a variety such that the highest end of the scale is not higher than 5 times the test pressure. For instance, a 3 psi test will need an optimum 15 pound gauge. A 10 psi test might be performed using a 50 pound gauge, however not a 100 pound gauge. The piping system shall be under test (pressurized) and the test gauge visible at the time of inspection.
