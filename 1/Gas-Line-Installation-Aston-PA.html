<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it difficult to gain access to in-wall pipes, think about at least replacing pipes that aren't buried in the walls. Although it's a huge task, changing exposed pipes in a basement, utility, or crawlspace  room is fairly simple, due to the fact that the plumber can easily get at the pipes. This is a bad sign. Toilets must definitely never ever wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet must be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
