<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
<p>Faulty pilot burner: This is an issue if you have a gas water heater. If the pilot light is having problem staying on, your hot water heater will ultimately stop operating. Fixing the pilot burner is a simple job, but one that need to nevertheless be carried out by a technician, as inappropriate repairs can result in a potential gas leak and other problems with the hot water heater. If the brand-new filament is not set up effectively, for instance, it might wind up more damaging your unit.</p>
