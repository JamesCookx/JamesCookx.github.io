Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
