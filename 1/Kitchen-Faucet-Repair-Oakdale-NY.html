<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common type of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- two layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow circumstance. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you eventually check a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow situation might occur. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a water company considers high threat" establishments.</p>
<p>Drain cleaning is an efficient way to clear away any obstructions, or particles that have built up in your plumbing system. However, there are specific situations when a cleaning might not suffice to get your drains back up and running effectively. In those instances, a repair could be needed as the drains have some amount of damage that might need a bit more work. Reach out to our Jonesboro drain service specialists today if you believe you may be in need of a repair.</p>
