<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. The majority of water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank. This tank is filled with resin beads, and the hardness ions (calcium and magnesium) attach themselves to these. The tank flushes itself when particular levels are met, and the system will need to have the salt in the brine tank renewed.</p>

<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
