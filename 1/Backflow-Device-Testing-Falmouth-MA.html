If you reside in a cold-weather environment, we extremely suggest repiping your house during spring or summer so you do not need to stress over freezing temperatures throughout the repiping process.

When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
