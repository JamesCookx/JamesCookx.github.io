<p>Storage centers and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Since water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe circulation rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, use never precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and easily saved for later usage when need rate surpasses supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
