<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
