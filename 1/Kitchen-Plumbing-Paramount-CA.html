<p>Installation and replacement costs are frequently comparable, though replacement usually will not need service charges, such as application costs. New meters must satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their positioning, and gas service providers may require a distinct meter for their services, limiting your choices. Contractors and do-it-yourselfers are accountable for scheduling inspections by calling the office number noted on the structure permit. Inspections must be made after structure excavation (prior to putting concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon completion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is discovered, the inspector will issue an offense notification, and a particular time period is set aside to fix the issue.</p>
