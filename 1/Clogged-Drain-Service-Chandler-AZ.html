Secure the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hose pipes need to have an air space. The end of the hose be at least two inches above the dedicated drain. An air space might be utilized to attain this, and might be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, rather than use the method set out above.

This is particularly true when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and then change instructions to drop the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee permits a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
