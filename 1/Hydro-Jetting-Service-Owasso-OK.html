<p>Roto-Rooter was featured in the SyFy tv program Ghost Hunters (2004-2016) as the two creators of TAPS work for Roto-Rooter as plumbers in the company's Providence, Rhode Island branch. There are sections including Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson working as plumbing specialists in their day tasks at Roto-Rooter in between paranormal investigations on the show.
