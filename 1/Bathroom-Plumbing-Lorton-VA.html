<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Lorton VA</h3>
<p>This is a completely valid concern that we hear a lot. The disposal unit is not, obviously, as important as your hot water heater, water line, or drainpipes. However, it includes a fair amount of functionality to the kitchen. A waste disposal unit is a reasonably small cylindrical device installed under the kitchen drain. When switched on, your disposal unit takes down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such debris. Rather, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can easily flow into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
<p>There are extra problems that might come up, which is why our skilled plumbers will perform a thorough inspection of your system to determine what has caused it to malfunction.

If you have old metal drain pipes covered in rust, you need to think about replacing them. Examine the rusted areas for leakages considering that this is commonly where they're found.</p>
