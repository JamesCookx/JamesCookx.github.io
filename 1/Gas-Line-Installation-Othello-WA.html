<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
