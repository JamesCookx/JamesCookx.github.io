<p>Are rust or minerals developing in your water? The 2 dead giveaways of rust and mineral buildup are low water pressure and reddish-brown water coming out of the faucet. As rust or minerals build up in time, they gradually start to restrict the circulation of water, leading to low water pressure.

<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Wiggins MS</h3>
<p>Reverse osmosis is the process utilized to purify water used for drinking and cooking. The water in our RO system goes through 3 stages. In the prefilter phase, big particles like silt and rust are removed by the filter. Next the water goes through the membrane. Hydrogen and oxygen go through the pores while dissolved solids are caught and removed. Finally, the water goes to the holding tank after going through one last stage of filtration to get rid of any remaining contaminants.</p>
<p>The most effective method to resolve tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
