Inspections need to be made after foundation excavation (prior to pouring concrete), after rough-in (before concealing work), and upon conclusion. KEEP IN MIND: If faulty work is found, the inspector will issue an infraction notification, and a particular time period is allocated to correct the issue.</p>
