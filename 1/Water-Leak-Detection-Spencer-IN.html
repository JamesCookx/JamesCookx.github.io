<p>Salt intake from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. If health or environmental factors necessitate limiting sodium, replacing potassium chloride for salt chloride may be appropriate. Gradually, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has 3 cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regeneration process can be scheduled automatically with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
