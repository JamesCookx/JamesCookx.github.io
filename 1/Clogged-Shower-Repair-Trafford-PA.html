<p>Read your insurance coverage policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Make certain you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurer will not cover a slow leak. Claims might be denied because the standard HO-3 house owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over an extended period of time." Call your insurance coverage representative and confirm your coverage. Double check with your agent to confirm that your understanding is right when you have read through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered.</p>

The proposition may be thought about and approved, if it meets the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
