<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow need, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
