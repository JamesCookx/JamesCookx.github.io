When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is likewise worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact in between the different metals.
