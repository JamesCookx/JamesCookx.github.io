<p>Unless your bathroom remodelling is simply cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may effectively be part of your job requirements. Water goes into the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which draws in the favorably charged minerals in the water (a procedure referred to as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits hold on to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout the house. Tankless technology makes good sense.

Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>

<p>If you identify a leak and go with a patching job rather of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the very same product and they may be next. To prevent further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backward.</p>
