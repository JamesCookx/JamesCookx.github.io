<p>Because of an issue at the point of installation or because of maintenance, water softeners leakages are primarily caused. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is cracked, it can also trigger the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed in time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and merely needs to be changed.</p>
