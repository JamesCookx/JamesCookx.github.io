<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems use both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
