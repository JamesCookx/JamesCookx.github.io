<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbers Churchville NY</h3>
<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and switch on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a nearby warm water faucet till you hear the burner in the water heater ignite. After a minute, move a smoking cigarettes match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke should be drawn up the vent pipe. If the smoke does not draw, the fumes from the burner aren't venting. Shut off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to fix the issue.</p>
