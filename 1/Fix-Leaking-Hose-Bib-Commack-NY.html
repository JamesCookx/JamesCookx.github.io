<p>Even if all appears well with your water heater, it's a great idea to schedule water heater service from time to time simply to make certain that everything is kosher. Sediment buildup is a typical problem with water heaters New Orleans, particularly in older systems. With time, magnesium, calcium, and limescale can collect on the sides of the tank and around the burner. These minerals must be filtered out of the system so they don't produce a sediment barrier on the burner and interrupt hot water heater performance. Hot water heater filtration can eliminate these minerals and prevent a malfunction. The burner must also be examined periodically to ensure that the flame is blue with a yellow tip. If the flame is yellow-orange, it will affect your hot water heater's performance, and it could release carbon monoxide gas fumes into your indoor air.</p>
