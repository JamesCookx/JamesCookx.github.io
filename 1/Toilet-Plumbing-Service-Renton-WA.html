<p>Using different metals in the plumbing can cause galvanic deterioration Direct contact between different metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever 2 various types of metal are conductively linked to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact in between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
