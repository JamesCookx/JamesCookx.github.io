The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector flows in reverse relative to the direction of the system's water system movement. This opposite circulation is usually localized and can arise from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller sized pipes subject to automobile traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of neighboring soil or moving foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as valves and meters, etc. The outcome is a total breakage, dislocation or breaking in the pipe that permits water to escape. In some cases no evident physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a key pump whose closed down results in a considerable pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply decades of protection. There are lots of local conditions that can shorten the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as excessive pressure, water temperature, turbidity or quality can all trigger the assembly to weaken in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies may rarely need repair while some are repaired on a regular basis. The test data from the field test will determine the repair frequency.</p>
