<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be avoided by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Substituting potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be appropriate if health or environmental reasons necessitate limiting sodium. With time, the beads become covered with minerals and need to be cleaned. This cleaning process, called regrowth, has three cycles: recharge, backwash and rinse. The regeneration procedure can be scheduled automatically with an electric timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer system.</p>
<p>This ion exchange process is assisted in by resin beads in the water softener that are charged with salt ions. This is another combination that can work on sink clogs. Mix about a cup of baking soda with a half-cup of salt, and pour down the drain. Let the mixture sit for several hours, then flush with boiling water. You can duplicate this process if it does not work the very first time.
