It might not be set up in any location where it may ever be immersed under water. Some towns do not permit the usage of PVBs with drip irrigation systems. Some don't permit the use of a PVB at all, so consult your water service provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it needs to be installed in an area where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>

<p>Siphonage into a pipe system. When there is a decline in supplied pressure to the water flow, takes place. The result is a backflow where liquid in the pipe sector streams backwards relative to the direction of the system's water supply movement. This opposite flow is generally localized and can result from a loss in upstream pressure from, for example, physical failure of the pipe wall or its joints. Such physical damage is more typical in smaller pipes subject to car traffic on overlaying roads, vibrations from adjacent heavy devices operations, settlement of close-by soil or shifting foundations, the wear and tear of pipe appurtenances such as meters and valves, etc. The outcome is a total damage, dislocation or splitting in the pipe that allows water to escape. Sometimes no obvious physical damage to the pipe is required, just the mechanical failure of a crucial pump whose shut down results in a substantial pressure drop throughout the pipe network.</p>
