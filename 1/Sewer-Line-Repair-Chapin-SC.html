<h3>Residential Plumbing Services Chapin SC</h3>
<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water system line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was really promoted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was simpler to install. Unfortunately, any house that plumbed with polybutylene resembles a ticking time bomb. It is not a concern of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or supported drain pipe is a problem. In some cases a house owner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. In some cases unclogging a drain takes disassembling the plug and putting a hook to pull out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even standing on one's head and murmuring necromancies to the drain gods.</p>
<p>If you identify a leak and choose a patching job rather of a repiping task, just keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the exact same product and they might be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your whole house when you spot a leak. If your plumber's auger line is too short to reach to the end of the pipe, reach you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
