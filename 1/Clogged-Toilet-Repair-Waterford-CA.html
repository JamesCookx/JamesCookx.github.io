When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water passes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it must be restored (cleaned up). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
