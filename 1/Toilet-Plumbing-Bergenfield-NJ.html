<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in an entirely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow defense. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow circumstance.
