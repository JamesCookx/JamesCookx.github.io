<p>When grinding food remains, use cold water. Prevent using warm water up until the garbage disposal is shut off. Most of the times, an absence of warm water is caused by a defective circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be split.

Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure includes 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this boost can present problems.</p>
