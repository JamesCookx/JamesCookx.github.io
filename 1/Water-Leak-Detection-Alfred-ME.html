<p>A water softener draws magnesium and calcium out of the water in order to "soften" it. However to do so, it must put something back into the water. Most water softeners utilize an ion exchange process where calcium and magnesium ions are exchanged for salt ions in the system's resin tank.

<h3>Plumbing Company Serving Alfred ME</h3>
<p>Our process begins with an inspection of the numerous problems dealt with by the property owner, this is followed by among our comprehensive group of professionals inserting a camera into the drains to recognize the blocked area and determine how best to proceed. In the past, a blocked drain indicated a snake would be used to pierce a hole in the drain to permit a small amount of wastewater to travel through the obstruction and keep the waste moving through the drain.</p>
<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
