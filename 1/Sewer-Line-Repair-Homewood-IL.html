<p>David Davia is the Executive Vice President & CEO of the Colorado Association of Mechanical and Plumbing Contractors. He called several of his member contractors to find out what a fair and reasonable  price would be for a garbage disposal install. Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular method of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- normally sodium. The outcome is water that's been efficiently softened by eliminating nearly all traces of the minerals that make up difficult water.</p>
