<p>To assist avoid obstructions within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge directly to the tee of an end-outlet continuous waste, rather than utilize the technique set out above. Because the baffle successfully halves the interior size of the tee, it's simple for waste from the disposer to clog it up. This is especially real when the waste must travel horizontally (down the arm) and after that change instructions to drop the trap.
