<p>pressure vacuum breakers: These are frequently used in industrial plants, cooling towers, labs, laundries, swimming pools, lawn sprinkler systems, and fire sprinkler systems. Pressure vacuum breakers use a check valve designed to close with the aid of a spring when water circulation stops.

The assembly includes resistant, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>

Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
