Standard salt-based systems include salt to the water which can have a negative effect on individuals with high-blood pressure and heart problem.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly.
