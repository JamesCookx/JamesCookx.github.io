Drainage is associated with potential health dangers, including undesirable smells and unhygienic conditions. A clogged toilet can provide a bad experience for your clients.</p>
<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
