<p>Unless your bathroom renovation is purely cosmetic in nature, bathroom plumbing may very well belong to your task requirements. Water enters the top of the water-softener tank and percolates down through the resin beads. The resin has a negative charge, which attracts the positively charged minerals in the water (a process known as, ion exchange). The mineral deposits cling to the resin and the now-softened water exits the softener tank and streams throughout the house. Tankless innovation makes good sense.
