<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not demand repairing the entire toilet. Like any house appliance, a toilet tank features numerous small moving parts that might need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leaks that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can likewise happen around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>

If your hot water heater isn't working, our skilled group of service technicians at Kramer and Sons is prepared to provide you with top-notch, same-day service. I bought it at Home Depot for $110 + $2 for Plumbers Putty. The putty is only used if you are planning on changing out the drain too, which I highly suggest. Switched out electrical cables considering that the initial looked excellent. Consisting of tax, I invested less than $125 to install it myself. Not extremely made complex.

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most home centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
