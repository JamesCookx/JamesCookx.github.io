<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
