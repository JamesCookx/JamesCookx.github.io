Pipes made from galvanized steel are no longer utilized in new homes, but numerous homes built between the 1930s - 1980s still have them. When discovered and replaced with another pipe material, galvanized steel pipes need to be removed by a professional plumber. Sump and sedimentation manholes separate the stormwater from sanitary water, reducing the volume and cost of treatment. Culvert repair diverts storm run-off and decreases erosion and run-off.

Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
