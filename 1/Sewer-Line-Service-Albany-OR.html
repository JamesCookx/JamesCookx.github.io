<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is generally used in the regeneration process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start once again.</p>
