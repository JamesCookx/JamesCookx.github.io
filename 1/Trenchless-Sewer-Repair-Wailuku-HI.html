After completing your high school diploma or General Educational Advancement (GED) in many cases, you may wish to think about going to a plumbing apprenticeship program.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For many people, this boost in salt is small, but if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet this increase can pose problems.</p>
