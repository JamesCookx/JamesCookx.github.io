For example, if you have a two piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your very first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can begin to harden and break or simply be so crushed that it doesn't fill the space as well as it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl washers and bolts can end up being corroded or so worn that they spring a leak. We strongly suggest also replacing your gasket and your bolt set to make sure everything is in tip-top shape Whenever you replace your flush valve.</p>
