<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact in between different metals will start the formation of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two various types of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be corroded and an electrical current is created due to the fact that of the process. A typical example of this is when galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the different metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating product that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
