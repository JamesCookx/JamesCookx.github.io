In a different drain path, little pipes range from the tub and sink to eventually meet a bigger one below the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home. A excellent method to lower the amount of food waste in your kitchen is to install a garbage disposal.

<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water developed in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is travelled through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the style). As this brine goes through the tank, sodium ions are transferred (exchanged) for the hardness ions on the exchange resin and these firmness ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues up until all the hardness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll see percentages of salt going to drain together with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regenerated.</p>
