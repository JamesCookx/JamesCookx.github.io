No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed throughout a backflow situation. When you eventually check a backflow preventer, those 1-pound springs are what you are testing. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That suggests that the check valve is holding shut with a minimum of 1 pound of force. The drawback of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the 2nd line of defense fails (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow scenario might take place. That is why this kind of valve is not defined for what a public utility considers high threat" establishments.</p>
