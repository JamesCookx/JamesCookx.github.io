This is just a non-mechanical pipe length forming a loop extending a minimum of 35 feet vertically above the water supply pipeline. The height is necessary to overcome the ambient air pressure (at mean sea level) of 34 feet of head (14.6959 psi). A loop of pipe this high avoids a siphon from forming. Its benefits are the simplicity of its style and lack of moving parts. Nevertheless, it may be unwise in many circumstances to install a pipe segment of this length.
